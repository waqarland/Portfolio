## About me
I'm a passionate software tester with 3+ years of software testing experience and a strong foundation in both manual and automated testing methodologies. I recently completed courses in Test Automation with Python and Software Testing Foundations, equipping me with the skills to write efficient and maintainable test cases using frameworks like Pytest.

My experience with Selenium and Cypress.io allows me to automate web browser interactions for thorough testing of web applications. Additionally, I'm familiar with various testing techniques like black-box testing and usability testing, ensuring comprehensive coverage throughout the development lifecycle.

Beyond the technical aspects, I'm a quick learner with a keen eye for detail. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and explore new testing tools and techniques.
